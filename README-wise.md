If you want to begin harnessing the full power of git its best to be social. Here are some quick instructions to get you up and going using git on Github.

Create an account at Github : http://github.com Note that with a .edu email address you can request a student or faculty account which will provide you with free private repos as well:

Follow instructions here for making sure your name and email are properly configured in git:

After you have added your SSH key to your git hub account per the instructions above you will be ready to go. For example if you wish to download the git repo for the bootcamp execute this command:
